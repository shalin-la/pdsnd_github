>**Note**: Please **fork** the current Udacity repository so that you will have a **remote** repository in **your** Github account. Clone the remote repository to your local machine. Later, as a part of the project "Post your Work on Github", you will push your proposed changes to the remote repository in your Github account.

### Project Title
Project for Intro. to Version Control

### Description
This project is the demonstration of my ability to use Git version control.
This involves simulating a realistic workflow to refactor my previous BikeShare Python project.

This project comprises four parts:
1. Setting up a repository - Forking and cloning a Udacity repository to my local computer. This will be used to upload my project files.
2. Improve Documentation - Create a branch using Git for adding docstrings and README file for the bikeshare project.
        Actions:
    *   Adding docstrings to user_stat function to explain why an if statement was created
    *   Removed To Do comments from the code
3. Refactor Code - Create a refactoring branch to improve my code and add missing components to the code.
        Actions:
    *   Added Raw Data function to iterate through raw data 5 rows at a time.
4. Merge Branches - Merge branches to the master branch that will be pushed to the remote repo.

### Files used
I used the initial bikeshare.py file
Read data from the following CSV files:
'chicago.csv'
'new_york_city.csv'
'washington.csv'
